# W32_GUI_Sub_Writer

This simple project let you find all specifically named files in defined subfolders, writing to it, writing registry value and notify the user for each found subfolder.


It needs to be executed in Wine (but that's easy to change).
GUI is really basic but of course, you can improve it.
Could be used to patch a lot of files... or just read them.
